## About

Forced desynchrony (FD) studies are designed to force desynchrony between circadian rhythms and sleep/wake (and associated behaviors). Under such conditions, the relative impact of circadian rhythms, duration of time awake or asleep, and their (non-linear) interactions on multiple physiological variables can be quantified. Variables include objective performance, subjective mood and alertness, EEG, ECG, sleep, and hormones.
